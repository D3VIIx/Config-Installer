# Config Installer
Config installer is an app created by me to help config users easily install/add config files with a click of a button, the app also lets you uninstall/remove config files easily with a click of a button.

To make your configs compatible with config installer it needs to follow certain rules and formats that config installer understands otherwise config installer would throw an error.
